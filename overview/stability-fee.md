# Stability Fee

Currently, DYAD operates as a zero interest rate stablecoin protocol.\
\
Expected in Q4 2024/Q1 2025: Interest rate based on peg (deviation).\
\
Under normal circumstances, when DYAD is pegged to 1 dollar, the system will not charge borrowers  interest. When implemented, rates will increase as peg decreases and vice versa.
