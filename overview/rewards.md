# Rewards

#### Introduction

Users that provide liquidity in one of our whitelisted liquidity pools (LP) are rewarded with Kerosene. Two different metrics are obtained to calculate the ''effective'' size, which in turn is used to determine the amount of rewards per user.

* XP multiplier
* LP multiplier

Each user obtains XP by depositing Kerosene into their note. The XP multiplier is four times as important compared to the LP multiplier. Hence, users that deposit Kerosene into their Note to accumulate XP have an advantage over Liquidity Providers without XP. The effective size of each note is obtained by the product of both multipliers(XP and LP). The ideal strategy to maximise Kerosene rewards is therefore to continuously earn more XP (via deposited Kerosene), while maintaining a reasonable LP size. Here, a good rule of thumb is to provide more than the average LP size.
