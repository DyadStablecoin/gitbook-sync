# Deterministic Value

Kerosene's value in the system, not to be confused by its market value, is set deterministically by the protocol via\


$$X = \frac{C - D}{K}$$

Where:

* X: the value of a single Kerosene token deposited in a Note as backing for DYAD
* C: the total USD value of all exogenous collateral in the protocol (TVL). Critically, this total does not include Kerosene itself
* D: the total supply of DYAD stablecoins
* K: the circulating supply of Kerosene tokens\
