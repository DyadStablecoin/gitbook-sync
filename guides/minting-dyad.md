* You're allowed mint DYAD up to the minimum collateral ratio of 150% (or Loan-to-Value of 0.67).  \
  Click mint, then review and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

<mark style="color:yellow;">`Please be advised that a collateral ratio below 150% will make your note eligible for liquidation. A user should always take potential volatility of the backing collateral into account. The system does not check for user error!`</mark>&#x20;
